   "description_text": "The 14th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2021-2025 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. Like previous five-year plans, the 14th Five Year plan sets out the direction of travel for China’s climate action over the period 2021 - 2025. It also contains references to the long-term direction of travel until 2035. The plan was released and ratified by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. The plan reiterates the previously announced target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and sets a goal of seeing emissions peak in 2030.   The most critical provision in the plan concerning climate is Article XXVIII, which contains a section entitled ‘Actively respond to climate change”, but various other provisions also touch on climate issues.  Relevant provisions are summarised below:   Article III: Main Goals   Section 1 of Article 3 sets out China’s long-term goals until 2035. It includes an emphasis on “green modes of production” and notes that “carbon emissions will decline steadily after reaching a peak”. More detailed objectives are set out in Section 2, which reads: “Energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 13.5% and 18% respectively, total emissions of the main pollutants will continue to fall, and the rate of forest coverage will increase to 24.1%. The ecological environment will continue to improve, ecological safety barriers will be made more secure, and urban and rural living environments will be significantly improved.”   Article IX: Develop and expand strategic emerging industries   Article 9 emphasises the need to seize opportunities for ecosystem driven development and includes provisions on bioenergy.    Article XI Build a modern infrastructure system   This article includes plans to develop low-carbon, clean energy, with a focus on wind, hydro and nuclear, referred to as a “modern energy system”. It includes the goal of increasing “the proportion of non-fossil energy in total energy consumption to about 20%.” The section also includes provisions for the development of coal power and oil and gas exploration, although plans to develop coal will be subject to controls and where possible coal will be replaced with electricity.   References are also made to improved flood control and prevention mechanisms and to improved rail transportation.   Article XXIX Comprehensively Improve Urban Quality   This article describes plans to create green, low-carbon cities and urban flood control systems.   Article XXXI   on the implementation of major regional strategies  Section 2 of this article states that China will adhere to ecological priority and sustainable development, and cooperate to promote environmental protection.  Section 5 states that the country will seek to \"reasonably control the intensity of coal development, promote the integrated development and utilisation of energy resources, and strengthen the ecological restoration of mines.\" Article XXXII on the implementation of coordinated development strategies at the regional scale  This article states under section 5 that the country will promote the comprehensive management of ecologically degraded areas and the protection and restoration of ecologically fragile areas and support the construction of the Bijie Pilot Area. Article XXXIII Actively expand the space for maritime economic development   This article contains provisions regarding protection of the marine environment, wetland conservation, and the maintenance of at least 25% of natural shoreline. Article XXXVII Improve the quality and stability of ecosystems This article contains references to eco-system repair and protection, and in particular goals to increase forest cover, engage in greening programmes, prevent soil erosion, and “increase the wetland protection rate to 55%”. Article XXVIII Continue to improve environmental quality  This article contains the most important climate provisions in the plan.   Section 4 of this article is titled “actively respond to climate change”. The section notes that China will formulate an action plan to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030. It includes plans to “implement a system that focuses on carbon intensity control with a secondary focus on total carbon emission control and support qualified localities, key industries, and key enterprises in taking the lead in reaching peak carbon emissions.” It also suggests plans to “increase controls on other greenhouse gases such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons” and “improve the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem” to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It also mentions plans to increase monitoring in vulnerable regions and implement adaptation measures and refers to China’s continued engagement with multi-lateral climate negotiations.   Section 5 of the article refers to plans to increase the potential for marketized trading in carbon emissions.  Subsequent sections refer to plans to “promote the clean and efficient use of fossil fuels such as coal, promote the green transformation of steel, petrochemical, building materials, and other industries, and accelerate “transfer from highways to railways” and “transfer from highways to waterways” for bulk cargo and medium- and long-distance cargo transportation”. Concrete measures outlined under this article also include plans to “implement major energy-saving and low-carbon technology industrialization demonstration projects and carry out major project demonstrations such as near-zero energy- consumption buildings, near-zero carbon emissions, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).”  Article XLI Promote high-quality “Belt and Road” development  This article sets out plans to continue China’s “Belt and Road” development and includes reference to international cooperation in the climate response and the creation of a Green Silk Road."

   "description_text": "The Contracts for Difference scheme is the current main mechanism for supporting large-scale generation of renewable electricity. It is a market-based mechanism, designed to provide a substantial incentive for all eligible forms of renewable electricity. CfDs incentivise investment in renewable energy by providing developers of projects with high upfront costs and long lifetimes with direct protection from volatile wholesale prices, and they protect consumers from paying increased support costs when electricity prices are high. The Scheme is administered by the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a private company administered by BEIS. The Contracts for Difference Scheme replaces the Renewables Obligation scheme which was closed to new generating capacity in 2017. The Renewables Obligation (RO) placed an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to source a specified and annually increasing proportion of their electricity sales from renewable sources, or pay a penalty. The obligation for 2009/10 was 9.7%, rising to 15.4% by 2015/6.   Previously, one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) was issued for each MWh of eligible generation, regardless of technology. In 2009, reforms gave new generators joining the RO different numbers of ROCs, depending on the costs and potential for large-scale deployment. New projects in more expensive technologies like offshore wind now receive more support and those that are more economic, like landfill gas, receive less.   Generators can sell their ROCs to electricity supply companies, which use them to demonstrate compliance with the Obligation. This enabled generators to receive a premium on top of the sale of the electricity. In 2010, changes to the scheme included the end date of the RO being extended to 2037, in order to provide greater long-term certainty for investors, and an increase in support for offshore wind projects meeting certain criteria.    The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the RO. Their functions include accrediting renewable generators and the issuing of ROCs."

Fossil fuels are subject to specific excise duties on the basis of weight or volume units. Biofuels are incentivised through a reduction of this excise duty. In particular, the Budget Law 2010 defines a maximum of 18,000 tonnes of biofuels that can benefit from this reduction. Italian legislation also stipulates that fossil fuel producers should annually supply a minimum quota of biofuels based on the total amount of fuel supplied during the previous year.  Revisions concerning green certificates (Finance law 2008 - Law No. 244 24/12/2007 and Law No. 222 29/11/2007): Putting a price on carbon: the revisions concerning green certificates are twofold. First, the incentive period is raised to 15 years. Second, the number of certificates issued varies depending on the type of renewable source, according to a coefficient of multiplicative energy produced.

It also established an obligation for all traditional fuel producers to supply, each year, a minimum quota of biofuels determined as a percentage of the previous year's total supply volume. The initial quota was 1% for 2007, subsequently it was increased to 2% for 2008 and 3% for 2009. Non-compliance with the quota is subject to penalties. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is responsible for verifying the fulfilment of this obligation. The Law introduced tax allowances for purchase or installation of high-efficiency electric motors and for high-efficiency fridges and freezers. It also promotes the reduction of duty for biofuels used for transportation and fiscal incentives for enhancing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy in buildings. The Law also established the Revolving fund for Kyoto: it provides EUR 200 million (USD 272 million) for financing measures to promote GHG emission reductions for 2010-2012 and to achieve the targets. It finances, for instance, a high-performance micro-cogeneration plant.  Fund for GHG emissions reduction and energy efficiency (Finance Law 2001 Art. 10): The financial law, approved at the end of the year 2000, establishes a fund for the reduction of atmospheric emissions and the promotion of energy efficiency and sustainable energy sources. The fund is financed from a portion equal to 3% of the receipts accruing from Italy's carbon tax. The fund will finance up to 80% of the cost of programmes for installation of solar collectors (mostly PV), particularly in southern Italy.

It is meant to provide a strategic, national spatial development framework that addresses current development issues, and provides a platform for feasible private and public sector development initiatives, reflecting local cultural values and aspirations over the next twenty years. The Sustainable Island Resource Management Zoning Plan (SIRMZP) of 2012 is itself designed to serve as a revised NPDP that meets the criteria of the Physical Planning Act.\n\nThe SIRMZP seeks more specific options to optimise the productive use of environmental resources while protecting critical ecosystems and promoting the local economic development, notably in the tourism, services, agriculture and industrial sectors. It does so by providing geographic and sectoral analysis to suggest low-carbon development scenarios forward, and climate change adaptation measures such as minimum ground floor elevation."

It calls for comprehensive measures to be taken against the pollution \"caused by the burning of coal, industrial production, motor vehicles and vessels, dust as well as agricultural activities\" (Art 2.). The objective is to restrict various sources of atmospheric pollutants, including \"air pollutants and greenhouse gases, including particles, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and ammonia etc.\" (Art 2.) and make information on atmospheric cleanliness more readily available to the public. \n \nThe 2015 revisions provide that China should promote clean and efficient use of coal, obliging local governments to ban low-quality coal for residential use (Chapter IV, Section 1). Art 32 calls for \"measures to improve energy structure and popularize the production and utilization of clean energy, optimize the utilization of coal to be cleaner and more effective, and reduce the proportion of coal in primary energy consumption and the discharge of atmospheric pollutants during the production, utilization and transformation of coal\". \n \nThe law provides for the Government to advocate low-carbon and eco-friendly transportation. \"The ownership of vehicles using petroleum fuels shall be controlled below an appropriate level in accordance with urban planning. Public transportation in urban areas shall be vigorously boosted to increase its proportion in overall transportation. The State shall adopt measures including fiscal and tax policy and government procurement to popularize motor vehicles and vessels and non-road mobile machineries that save energy, protect the environment and use new energy, to limit motor vehicles and vessels and non-road mobile machineries that feature high level oil consumption and emission, and to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels\" (Art 50). The law calls for establishment of a gasoline quality standard matched with the country's restriction requirements for major pollutants (Art 13), including sulfur, olefin, arenes and benzene. \n \nThe law calls the relevant state environmental department to \"observe and simulate atmospheric conditions and use new technologies of artificial satellites, photogrammetric measurement and long-distance monitoring so as to analyze the sources and future trend of atmospheric pollution in these key areas. The department shall release such analyses to the public\" (Art 91). \n \nThe law also provides greater environmental transparency to the public. It stipulates authorities of the State Council should evaluate provincial-level governments on their attainment of air quality improvement targets. The law also specifies other items to be disclosed publicly, including air quality standard, catalogue of major polluters, contact information of environmental authorities and supervisors, test results on the emissions of new vehicles, and sources and fluctuations of air pollution in important areas (Chapter III). \n \nViolations or non-compliance with the law may result in fines between 5,000RMB (USD$760) and 1,000,000 RMB (USD$ 152,000), based on severity of offense, type of entity, operation and recurrence of offense (Chapter VII). \nThe law was originally adopted on September 5, 1987, amended according to the Decision on Revising the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution on August 29, 1995, revised on April 29, 2000, and most recently revised again on August 29, 2015."

The Act authorised development of emission standards for stationary sources. In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established four new regulatory programmes:  - National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) - EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation)  - State Implementation Plans (SIPs)  - New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)  - National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)    The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above.    Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection.    The EPA's 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect.    The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established, and the EPA is currently promulgating standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants and has announced plans to regulate GHG emissions from additional stationary sources."

   "description_text": "The CO2 Act is the core of Switzerland's climate policy: its objectives, instruments and measures. The CO2 Ordinance specifies how the different instruments are implemented and contains more detailed regulations on all the instruments mentioned in the CO2 Act. Details of the CO2 Levy on Process and Heating Fuels has been integrated under this Ordinance, which originally stipulated the following: \n \nThe initial levy was set at CHF12 (USD12.5) per tonne of CO2, which equates to CHF0.03 USD.03)/litre of heating oil and CHF 0.025 (USD.026)/m3 of natural gas. As CO2 emission reductions were not on track to meet the commitments, the CO2 tax was increased to CHF36 (USD37.6) per tonne of CO2. The revenues of the first phase (2008-2010) were re-distributed to employers and to the population on a per-capita basis. Since 2010, one third of the revenues have been channelled to the building refurbishment programme (about CHF300m, USD313m)."

   "sectors": ["Waste","Transportation","Energy","Economy-wide","Residential and Commercial"],
   "description_text": "Following from Sweden's Integrated Climate and Energy Policy Bills, this action plan sets out the specific measures to achieve the objective of a fossil fuel independent vehicle fleet by 2030. Given that one third of emissions occur in the road-based transportation sector, the fossil fuel independent vehicle fleet is a key contribution to Sweden's GHG emission reduction target. \n \nThe key principle is to put a price on the GHG emissions emitted by the transportation sector and thus encouraging a move towards fossil fuel independent fuels as non-fossil fuel based vehicles are becoming cheaper than fossil fuel based vehicles. This is to be achieved through various policy instruments, measures, initiatives and incentives. \n \nThese include carbon pricing (emission trading, energy and especially carbon taxes) in the transportation sector, increasing the dialogue between the government and the automotive cluster to strengthen its long-term competitiveness and promote greener fuel development and vehicle technology, extension of subsidies to establish filling stations for renewable fuels, increasing the share of biofuels in road transportation fuels via implementing the EU fuel quality directive (up to 10% share of biodiesel in the mixture), the requirement that thesustainability criteria must be fulfilled if the biofuels are to count towards the 10% target of fuels from renewable energy sources by 2020, mandating of binding emission standards for automotive manufacturers at 120gCO2/km for new passenger cars, which will be gradually reduced to 95gCO2/km in 2020, exploring the potential for the use of biogas (e.g. from waste) as transportation fuel, i.e. the development of 2nd generation biofuel via financial support (SEK875m USD118.4m) for biofuel demo-plants and the commercialisation of new energy technology, research and development initiatives to assess the incentives for the emerging electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids market, including appropriate stimulus and raising public awareness via consumer information on vehicle fuel consumption."

   "policy_title": "An Integrated Climate and Energy Policy",
   "sectors": ["Environment","Transportation","LULUCF","Industry","Energy","Agriculture"],
   "description_text": "Passed by the Riksdag in 2009, these laws originating in two government bills form the basis of Sweden's flagship climate policy, known as 'an Integrated Climate and Energy Policy. \n \nThe Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards, adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides, research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited). \n \nThe Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector. \n \nTargets outlined in this legislation include: \n- 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels) \n- 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020 \n- 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008) \n- 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector \n- by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating \n- by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels \n- by 2050: zero net emissions of GHGs in Sweden."
